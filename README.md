# Basketball
Ongoing Project

This is a big project that I'm in the early stages of.  Basically the plan is to acquire as much NBA data as possible, use some insights gained from "Thinking Basketball" to identify key metrics that lead to an NBA team's success.

The program scrapes data from Basketball-Reference.com using BeautifulSoup, then collected its compiled in my MySQL Workspace.  From there the data will be analyzed using various statistical analyses & learning methodologies.  Ideally, the historical data can be used to decipher the chaos of modern basketball within a reasonable turnaround to a dashboard I will have built in Tableau.

Overall, this is a lofty and lengthy goal for me but I think one that will have great learning advantages.
